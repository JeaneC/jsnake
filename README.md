This game is my first solo-project in python.

This program uses Pygame to re-create the classic snake game.

V 0.05 - Program hardly created. Just created a bunch of basic files ( a lot are blank)
- settings.py created
- scoreboard.py created
_ game_stats.py created
- game_functions.py created
- button.py created
- j_snake.py created
- snake.py created

Update V 0.30
- The game is more defined now
- Food does randomly spawn everywhere
- The snake's body has yet to be fixed yet though, and for now only stays as 1 block

Update V 0.40
- Uh... The program kinda got worse...
- Not sure how to make the python bigger
